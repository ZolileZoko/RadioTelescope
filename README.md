# Radio Astronomy Horn Antenna

## Overview
This repository documents the design, simulation, and implementation of a horn antenna for radio astronomy. The goal is to receive and analyze celestial radio emissions, such as those from the Milky Way.

## Project Goals
- Design a horn antenna optimized for radio astronomy frequencies.
- Simulate the antenna performance using Altair Feko EM software.
- Build and test the antenna with an SDR (Software Defined Radio).
- Process collected data to visualize astronomical radio signals.
